    "### In this kernel, I will walk you through some methods used to denoise seismic signals (and other signals in general) and explain exactly how they work. We will look at <a href='#1'>Wavelet Denoising with High-Pass Filters</a> and <a href='#1'>Average Smoothing</a>. The first method is used to remove the artificial impulse and the latter one is used to remove general noise.\n",

    "The main problem in the specific case of seismic signals is the fact that the signal we measure with a seismograph is not an accurate representation of the actual underground seismic signal we are trying to uncover. **In seismology, we (the people trying to measure the seismic signals) artificially generate signals called impulse signals. These impulse signals interact with the Earth's actual seismic signal (which is what we need) to produce the final signal which our seismograph picks up** (this same process takes place in the laboratory simulation of an earthquake). So, the real challenge is to uncover the actual signal from mixed seismogram (which is a combination of the Earth's impulse signal and the artificial impulse signal).\n",

    "The filtered signals are now passed through [wavelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet) decomposition (and the wavelet coefficients are obtained). It has to be understood that the raw signal we are working with is a convolution of the artificial and real impulse signals and this is why we need to \"wavelet decomposition\". The process is a sort of \"deconvolution\", which means it undoes the convolution process and uncovers the real Earth impulse from the mixed seismogram and the artificial impulse. We make use of the MAD value to understand the randomness in the signal and accordingly decide the minimum threshold for the wavelet coefficients in the time series. We filter out the low coefficients from the wavelet coefficients and reconstruct the real Earth signal from the remaining coefficients and that's it; we have successfully removed the impulse signal from the seismogram and obtained the real Earth signal."
